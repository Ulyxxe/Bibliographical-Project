abstract = {Röntgen's discovery of a new type of radiation is the epochal event in a series of highlights of physics emerging within only a few decades of the late 19th century. As these discoveries are directly or indirectly rooting in the study of the phenomenon of electric discharge in gases a brief look at the physics scenario in the immediate pre-X-ray era is presented in the first section. Rather than just the fortune with the bold it is Röntgen’s character as a diligent, self-critical and ingenious scientist which made his discovery possible. This will be illustrated in the sections on Röntgen’s personal life and some specific details of his experiments leading to the discovery of X-rays. Finally, a short overview is given on the potential and the large variety of applications of X-rays.}

\chapter{Historical Background}
\section{Radiation Understanding in the Late 19\textsuperscript{th} century}
  Here we’ll talk about the scientific and technological developments preceding Röntgen's work. We will also talk about the state of physics and understanding of radiation in the late 19th century. 

\chapter{Life and Career of Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen}
\section{Early Life of an enthusiastic genius}
Sometimes history is made of incredible destiny. Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen, born on March 27\textsuperscript{th}, 1845 near Dusseldorf, Germany was not incline to brillant physics studies. 
His father a sheet merchant did not push him throughout this way. Rôntgen's early life was marked by a move to Netherlands for his father's business.
\section{Röntgen's groundbreaking experiment}
First, we will do a quick biography of Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen's early life and education, his career progression and key influences. Then we will talk over how his background contributed to his groundbreaking work.~\footfullcite{NUSSLIN202065}\\

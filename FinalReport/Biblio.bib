abstract = {Röntgen's discovery of a new type of radiation is the epochal event in a series of highlights of physics emerging within only a few decades of the late 19th century. As these discoveries are directly or indirectly rooting in the study of the phenomenon of electric discharge in gases a brief look at the physics scenario in the immediate pre-X-ray era is presented in the first section. Rather than just the fortune with the bold it is Röntgen’s character as a diligent, self-critical and ingenious scientist which made his discovery possible. This will be illustrated in the sections on Röntgen’s personal life and some specific details of his experiments leading to the discovery of X-rays. Finally, a short overview is given on the potential and the large variety of applications of X-rays.}

abstract = {Objectives
This paper will outline the status and basic principles of artificial intelligence (AI) in radiography along with some thoughts and suggestions on what the future might hold. While the authors are not always able to separate the current status from future developments in this field, given the speed of innovation in AI, every effort has been made to give a view to the present with projections to the future.
Key findings
AI is increasingly being integrated within radiography and radiographers will increasingly be working with AI based tools in the future. As new AI tools are developed it is essential that robust validation is undertaken in unseen data, supported by more prospective interdisciplinary research. A framework of stronger, more comprehensive approvals are recommended and the involvement of service users, including practitioners, patients and their carers in the design and implementation of AI tools is essential. Clearer accountability and medicolegal frameworks are required in cases of erroneous results from the use of AI-powered software and hardware. Clearer career pathways and role extension provision for healthcare practitioners, including radiographers, are required along with education in this field where AI will be central.
Conclusion
With the current growth rate of AI tools it is expected that many of the applications in medical imaging will continue to develop to more accurate, less expensive and more readily available versions moving from the bench to the bedside. The hope is that, alongside efficiency and increased patient throughput, patient centred care and precision medicine will find their way in, so we will not only deliver a faster, safer, seamless clinical service but also one that will have the patients at its heart.
Impact for practice
AI is already reaching clinical practice in many forms and its presence will continue to increase over the short and long-term future. Radiographers must learn to work with AI, embracing it and maximising the positive outcomes from this new technology.}

abstract = {X-ray imaging is a low-cost, powerful technology that has been extensively used in medical diagnosis and industrial nondestructive inspection. The ability of X-rays to penetrate through the body presents great advances for noninvasive imaging of its internal structure. In particular, the technological importance of X-ray imaging has led to the rapid development of high-performance X-ray detectors and the associated imaging applications. Here, we present an overview of the recent development of X-ray imaging-related technologies since the discovery of X-rays in the 1890s and discuss the fundamental mechanism of diverse X-ray imaging instruments, as well as their advantages and disadvantages on X-ray imaging performance. We also highlight various applications of advanced X-ray imaging in a diversity of fields. We further discuss future research directions and challenges in developing advanced next-generation materials that are crucial to the fabrication of flexible, low-dose, high-resolution X-ray imaging detectors.}}

abstract = {Publisher Summary
This chapter discusses an analysis of sound waves. Sound consists of longitudinal waves in the air. The term is loosely used also for corresponding vibrations in other media. Particle velocity is another useful parameter for graphical representation. The inverse square law states that for a point source of waves that is capable of radiating omnidirectionally and with no obstructions in the vicinity, the intensity I decreases with the square of the distance, d, from the source. The Doppler effect is the apparent change of frequency of a received sound when there is relative movement between the source and the observer. The frequency of any wave is defined as the number of complete waves emitted or received in one second. The ear drum, or tympanum, is a delicate membrane that is caused to move by sound wave pressures and attached to it is a chain of bones called the ossicles. Resonances can occur between two parallel surfaces when their spacing is equal to an odd number of half-wavelengths. Exposure to excessively loud sounds can lead to hearing damage. Psychoacoustics means somewhat obscure region between the physical characteristics of sound and the psychological interpretation of them by the brain. Echo is defined as a repetition when there is a perceptible time interval between the first and second sound, it being assumed that the repeat has essentially the same characteristics as the first sound.}
